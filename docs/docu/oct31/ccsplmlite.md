# CcspLMLite Documentation

CcspLMLite (LAN Manager Lite) is the RDK-B component responsible for managing and monitoring LAN-side network devices and hosts connected to the gateway. This component serves as the primary interface for discovering, tracking, and reporting network connectivity status, device information, and traffic analytics for connected devices across WiFi, Ethernet, and MoCA interfaces. LMLite provides comprehensive host management capabilities including device discovery, presence detection, network traffic monitoring, and telemetry reporting. It implements TR-181 data model parameters for hosts management and integrates with WebPA for cloud-based management and monitoring. CcspLMLite acts as a centralized hub for collecting network device information from various sources and presenting a unified view through standardized TR-181 interfaces.

As a core RDK-B service, CcspLMLite enables advanced features like parental controls, device management, network analytics, and presence-based automation by maintaining real-time awareness of all connected devices and their network activity patterns.

**Key Features & Responsibilities**: 

- **Host Discovery & Management**: Automatically discovers and tracks all devices connected to LAN interfaces including WiFi, Ethernet, and MoCA with real-time status monitoring and device profiling capabilities
- **Network Traffic Analytics**: Collects and reports detailed network traffic statistics per device including bandwidth usage, connection patterns, and performance metrics for capacity planning and troubleshooting
- **Device Presence Detection**: Implements presence detection algorithms using multiple detection methods to determine device online/offline status with configurable sensitivity and notification capabilities  
- **TR-181 Data Model Implementation**: Provides comprehensive TR-181 compliant interface for Device.Hosts object hierarchy enabling standardized access to host information through BBF-specified parameters
- **Cross-Interface Synchronization**: Coordinates device information across multiple network interfaces ensuring consistent device tracking and preventing duplicate entries across WiFi, MoCA, and Ethernet connections


## Design

CcspLMLite follows a modular, event-driven architecture designed to efficiently manage network device discovery, monitoring, and reporting across network interfaces. The design emphasizes scalability, real-time responsiveness, and data consistency while maintaining minimal system resource utilization. The architecture separates ownership between device discovery, data model management, telemetry reporting, and external communications through well-defined interfaces and protocols.

The component operates as a central aggregation point for network device information, collecting data from multiple sources including WiFi association events, DHCP lease notifications, ARP table monitoring, and interface-specific discovery mechanisms. The design implements intelligent caching and synchronization strategies to maintain accurate device state information while minimizing network scanning overhead. Event-driven updates ensure real-time responsiveness to network changes while batch processing optimizes telemetry data transmission and reduces system load.

The northbound interface provides TR-181 compliant access through RBus messaging, enabling seamless integration with other RDK-B components and external management systems. The southbound interface abstracts network interface interactions through HAL APIs and system-level networking calls. Data persistence is achieved through integration with the Persistent Storage Manager (PSM) ensuring device information survives system reboots. WebPA integration enables cloud-based management and telemetry reporting following industry-standard protocols and data formats including Avro serialization for efficient data transmission.

**Runtime State Changes and Context Switching**

During normal operation, CcspLMLite responds to various network events and configuration changes that may affect its operational context and device tracking behavior.

**State Change Triggers:**

- Network interface up/down events causing rescan of device discovery mechanisms
- Configuration parameter changes affecting scanning intervals, presence detection sensitivity, or telemetry settings  
- External service availability changes (PSM reconnection, WebPA service restart) requiring connection re-establishment
- Resource constraint conditions triggering degraded mode operation with reduced scanning frequency

**Context Switching Scenarios:**

- Interface priority changes when primary network interface fails, switching to backup scanning methods
- Discovery mode transitions between active scanning and passive monitoring based on network load conditions
- Telemetry reporting context switches between real-time and batch modes based on cloud connectivity status

## Implementation Details

### Major HAL APIs Integration

CcspLMLite integrates with multiple HAL interfaces to collect comprehensive network device information across different interface types. The component abstracts hardware-specific implementations through standardized HAL APIs while maintaining flexibility for platform-specific optimizations.

**Core HAL APIs:**

| HAL API | Purpose | Implementation File |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `wifi_getAssociatedDeviceDetail()` | Retrieve detailed information about WiFi-connected devices including signal strength, capabilities, and connection statistics | `lm_main.c`, network interface handlers |

| `dhcp_get_client_info()` | Access DHCP server lease table for IP address assignments, hostname information, and lease duration data | `lm_util.c`, DHCP client enumeration |
| `ethernet_hal_get_param()` | Query Ethernet interface status, link speed, duplex mode, and physical connection state | `network_devices_interface.c` |


### Key Implementation Logic

- **Device Discovery Engine**: Multi-threaded scanning system combining active probing, passive monitoring, and event-driven updates with intelligent caching to minimize network overhead while maintaining real-time device tracking accuracy. Periodic ARP table scanning with configurable intervals (15-300 seconds). DHCP lease monitoring through file system watchers and HAL callbacks. Interface-specific discovery protocols (WiFi association events, MoCA topology changes). State transition handlers implementing device lifecycle management with timeout-based cleanup.
  
- **Event Processing**: Asynchronous event handling system managing device state changes, network topology updates, and external service communications with guaranteed delivery and retry mechanisms. Event queue management with priority-based processing for critical network changes. Rate limiting and deduplication for high-frequency events (WiFi roaming, signal fluctuations). Asynchronous telemetry data transmission with batching and compression optimization.
  
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Comprehensive error detection and recovery mechanisms ensuring system stability during network disruptions, HAL failures, and resource constraints. Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for transient network errors. Graceful degradation during resource exhaustion with priority-based service reduction. Health monitoring and self-recovery capabilities including automatic component restart. Timeout handling and retry logic with configurable parameters for different operation types.
  
- **Logging & Debugging**: Multi-level logging system with runtime verbosity control and specialized debugging tools for network device tracking and performance analysis. Structured logging with JSON formatting for automated log analysis and monitoring. Real-time debugging interfaces for troubleshooting device discovery issues and network connectivity problems. Debug hooks providing detailed trace information for device state transitions, HAL interactions, and IPC communications. Performance monitoring with metrics collection for response times, memory usage, and network scanning efficiency.
