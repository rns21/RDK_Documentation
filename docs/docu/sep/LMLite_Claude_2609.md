## Design

### Highâ€‘Level Design Principles

CcspLMLite follows a modular, event-driven architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns and loose coupling between functional components. The design prioritizes real-time responsiveness for presence detection while maintaining data consistency across multiple network interfaces. Scalability is achieved through efficient data structures and periodic harvesting mechanisms that can handle up to 256 concurrent devices. Reliability is ensured through robust error handling, graceful degradation during interface failures, and persistent state management via PSM integration. Security considerations include MAC address validation, IP address verification, and controlled access to sensitive network information through TR-181 parameter permissions.

The component implements clear boundaries between data collection (host discovery), data processing (presence detection algorithms), data storage (device state management), and data presentation (TR-181 interface). Interface management responsibilities are distributed across specialized modules: network interface abstraction handles multi-interface coordination, DML modules manage TR-181 parameter operations, and telemetry modules handle data serialization and reporting. The design supports both polling-based and event-driven data collection modes to optimize performance based on network conditions and device requirements.

```

### Threading Model

CcspLMLite implements a multi-threaded architecture with dedicated worker threads for different functional areas. The main application thread handles initialization, CCSP message bus communication, and TR-181 parameter requests. A dedicated device discovery thread continuously monitors network interfaces and processes new device connections. The presence detection engine runs in its own thread with configurable polling intervals (default 10 seconds) to check device active/inactive states. Traffic monitoring operates in a separate background thread to collect bandwidth statistics without impacting real-time operations. Event processing threads handle WebPA message publishing and RBus event notifications. Thread synchronization is managed through mutex locks and condition variables to ensure data consistency across concurrent operations while maintaining responsive user interface interactions.

## Internal Modules

The CcspLMLite component consists of several specialized modules that work together to provide comprehensive network device management functionality. The core LM (LAN Management) module orchestrates device discovery and maintains the central device database. DML modules provide TR-181 parameter interface implementations for different functional areas. Network interface handlers abstract platform-specific networking operations, while telemetry modules handle data serialization and cloud communication.

Parameters include device identification, network interface associations, traffic statistics, and vendor-specific device classification.
- **Parameter Registration**: Parameters are registered through CCSP message bus integration using XML-based data model definitions from LMLite.XML configuration file. Access control is managed through TR-181 parameter permissions with read-only and read-write designations based on security requirements.
- **Custom Extensions**: X_CISCO_COM device type classification for enhanced device identification, X_RDKCENTRAL-COM presence detection controls for configurable monitoring, X_RDK presence notification system for real-time alerts, and traffic counting extensions for bandwidth management and analytics.

## Implementation Details

- **Key Algorithms or Logic**: Device discovery uses ARP table monitoring combined with network interface scanning to detect new device connections (`lm_wrapper.c`, `network_devices_interface.c`). Presence detection implements a dual-mode algorithm using IPv4/IPv6 ping with configurable retry counts and timeout intervals (`device_presence_detection.c`). Traffic monitoring utilizes netlink socket integration to capture per-device bandwidth statistics with aggregation logic for WAN interface monitoring (`cosa_wantraffic_utils.c`). State machine management for device lifecycle transitions between connected/disconnected/active/inactive states with hysteresis to prevent flapping (`lm_main.c`).

- **Error Handling Strategy**: Comprehensive error detection includes network interface failure recovery, CCSP message bus reconnection logic, and graceful degradation when HAL components are unavailable. Errors are categorized by severity with different response strategies: critical errors trigger component restart, warning conditions enable fallback modes, and informational errors continue with limited functionality. All error conditions are logged with structured information including error codes, component context, and recovery actions taken.

- **Logging & Debugging**: Multi-level logging system with categories for device discovery (LM), presence detection (PD), traffic monitoring (TM), and telemetry (TEL). Verbosity levels include ERROR, WARN, INFO, and DEBUG with runtime configuration through TR-181 parameters. Debug tools include device table dumps, presence detection state visualization, traffic statistics reporting, and message bus transaction logging. Performance metrics tracking for polling intervals, response times, and memory utilization with configurable thresholds for system monitoring.
