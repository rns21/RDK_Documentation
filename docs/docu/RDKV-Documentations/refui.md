# RDK Reference UI (rdke-refui)

---

RDK Reference UI (`rdke-refui`) is a Lightning.js-based resident application that serves as the home screen and UI shell for RDK Video reference platforms. It runs as the always-present foreground application on the device, presenting a navigable home screen, settings, media playback controls, and an application launcher. The UI communicates bidirectionally with the RDK middleware stack — primarily through ThunderJS (WPEFramework JSON-RPC) for device service control and through the Firebolt SDK for application lifecycle, localization, and metrics.

At the device level, it acts as the orchestrator of the user-visible surface: managing which application window is in focus, intercepting remote-control key presses, handling power state transitions, and launching or exiting third-party applications. At the module level, it encapsulates distinct API adapter classes for every Thunder plugin it interacts with, a Lightning Router-based screen navigation engine, and a set of overlay and widget components that can be rendered independently of the active route.

**Key Features & Responsibilities:**

- **Home Screen & Navigation**: Presents the main menu, side panel, top panel, and a configurable application grid through the Lightning Router. Supports routes including `menu`, `settings`, `epg`, `applauncher`, `usb`, and `player`.
- **Application Lifecycle Management**: Launches, monitors, and terminates third-party applications via `org.rdk.AppManager`, updates window visibility and focus via `org.rdk.RDKWindowManager`, and tracks the currently topmost application in `GLOBALS.topmostApp`.
- **Remote Control Key Handling**: Registers key intercepts with `org.rdk.RDKWindowManager` at startup for Home, Power, Volume, and shortcut keys. Routes key events to the active screen or widget, and forwards relevant keys to the focused application window.
- **Power State Management**: Subscribes to `onPowerModeChanged` from `org.rdk.PowerManager` and suppresses non-power key events during sleep states. Wakes the device to the `ON` state on any user key press.
- **Network Management**: Interfaces with `org.rdk.NetworkManager` for Wi-Fi scanning, connecting, IP configuration, and internet connectivity checks. Displays network setup screens during the splash/onboarding flow.
- **Media Playback**: Embeds an AAMP-based video player (`AAMPVideoPlayer`) for VOD and DTV channel playback. The `DTVApi` class interfaces with the `DTV` Thunder plugin for live TV channel and EPG data.
- **Settings Management**: Provides screens and overlays for picture settings (`org.rdk.tv.ControlSettings`), audio settings, sleep timer, screen saver, language, and time zone. User preferences are persisted via `org.rdk.PersistentStore` and `org.rdk.UserSettings`.
- **Voice & Alexa Integration**: Activates `org.rdk.VoiceControl` for keyword detection and voice session lifecycle. The `AlexaApi` class extends `VoiceApi` to handle SmartScreen activation and application state reporting to the Alexa cloud.
- **Firebolt Provider Integration**: Registers `PinChallengeProvider`, `AckChallengeProvider`, and `KeyboardUIProvider` with the Firebolt manage SDK to satisfy UI challenge prompts from Firebolt-capable applications.
- **Miracast Screen Mirroring**: Activates `org.rdk.MiracastService` and `org.rdk.MiracastPlayer`, presents the connection notification overlay, and manages accept/reject flows for incoming Miracast client connections.
- **Application Package Management**: Uses `org.rdk.AppPackageManager` (via `PackageManagerApi`) to list, install, and remove application packages, and relays install/uninstall events from `org.rdk.AppManager` to registered UI listeners.
- **Inactivity & Energy Saving**: Monitors user inactivity through `org.rdk.RDKShell` inactivity reporting, and applies configurable screen saver, energy saver, and sleep timer timeouts stored in browser-side `localStorage`/`Storage`.

## Design

The application is structured as a single-page Lightning.js application bootstrapped via `@lightningjs/sdk`'s `Launch()` entry point. The root `App` class extends `Router.App` and owns all global widgets (Menu, Volume overlay, Channel overlay, Settings overlay, App Carousel, Miracast notification). Page-level components are managed by the Lightning Router, which maps URL-like hash paths to Lightning components. This decouples screen logic from the shell layer: each screen or overlay only needs to know its own state, while the `App` class orchestrates global events and key routing.

Interactions with the northbound (Firebolt apps) are handled by registering Firebolt SDK providers (`PinChallenge`, `AcknowledgeChallenge`, `Keyboard`) so that Firebolt-capable apps can invoke UI challenges. The southbound layer — WPEFramework/Thunder — is accessed exclusively through ThunderJS over a WebSocket connection to `127.0.0.1:9998`. Each plugin has a dedicated adapter class in `src/api/`, isolating JSON-RPC call construction and event subscription from UI logic.

State shared across screens is held in `GLOBALS` (a module-level object in `Config.js`) and in the Lightning `Storage` API, which wraps `localStorage`. `AppController` maintains the identity of the main client window and the currently focused application instance, coordinating window visibility transitions when apps are launched or exit.

Firebolt SDK's `Metrics` API is used consistently across all API adapter classes to report plugin errors to the telemetry layer without blocking the UI thread.

#### Threading Model

- **Threading Architecture**: Single-threaded (JavaScript event loop within the WPE browser runtime).
- **Main Thread**: Handles all Lightning rendering, key events, ThunderJS WebSocket callbacks, and Firebolt SDK event callbacks. All API calls are asynchronous (Promise-based) and do not block the render loop.
- **Async / Event Dispatch**: ThunderJS delivers JSON-RPC event notifications via WebSocket callbacks registered with `thunder.on()`. Firebolt SDK delivers lifecycle and localization events via `Lifecycle.listen()` / `Localization.listen()`. All callbacks dispatch synchronously on the JavaScript event loop and update component state or trigger `Router.navigate()` calls.
- **Synchronization**: All shared state is accessed through the JavaScript event loop, which serialises execution. Each API adapter class exposes a static `get()` factory method that returns a shared instance per class. `GLOBALS` properties use getter/setter pairs to manage shared state with logging side effects.

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

#### Platform and Integration Requirements

- **Build Dependencies**: `@lightningjs/sdk ^4.8.1`, `ThunderJS` (rdkcentral fork), `@firebolt-js/sdk 0.15.0`, `@firebolt-js/manage-sdk 1.1.0`, `esbuild ^0.17.18` (bundler), Lightning CLI (`@lightningjs/cli`).
- **Plugin Dependencies**: `org.rdk.AppManager`, `org.rdk.RDKWindowManager`, `org.rdk.RDKShell`, `org.rdk.NetworkManager`, `org.rdk.PowerManager`, `org.rdk.PersistentStore`, `org.rdk.UserSettings`, `org.rdk.Bluetooth`, `org.rdk.HdmiInput`, `org.rdk.HdmiCecSource`, `org.rdk.Xcast`, `org.rdk.VoiceControl`, `org.rdk.MiracastService`, `org.rdk.MiracastPlayer`, `org.rdk.TextToSpeech`, `org.rdk.tv.ControlSettings`, `DTV`, `LISA`, `org.rdk.AppPackageManager`, `org.rdk.System`, `SmartScreen`.
- **Systemd Services**: The application is served by a `lighttpd` web server instance that maps the `/lxresui` alias to the installed dist directory. The WPE browser process must be running and pointing to the UI's `index.html`.
- **Configuration Files**:
  - `settings.json` — Lightning SDK platform and stage settings, loaded at application startup from the static directory.
  - `bolt/package-configs/com.rdkcentral.refui.json` — Application manifest used by the package manager to describe entry point, version, and required permissions.
  - `static/data/AppListInfo.js` — Static list of pre-configured partner applications shown in the home screen application grid.
  - `static/moreChannels/ChannelData.json` — Supplementary channel list fetched at runtime from `http://127.0.0.1:50050/lxresui/static/moreChannels/ChannelData.json`.
- **Startup Order**: The WPE browser runtime must be fully initialised and the ThunderJS WebSocket endpoint (`127.0.0.1:9998`) must be reachable before `AppController.init()` completes its `AppManager.getLoadedApps()` call. `org.rdk.RDKWindowManager` must be active for key intercept registration to succeed.

### Component State Flow

#### Initialization to Active State

When the WPE runtime loads the application, `index.js` calls `Launch(App)`, which triggers `App._setup()`. The router is started, `AppController.get().init()` identifies the main client window through `org.rdk.AppManager` or `org.rdk.RDKWindowManager`, and key intercepts are registered with `org.rdk.RDKWindowManager`. Once the splash screen route completes its onboarding checks (language selection, network configuration, pairing code if required), the router navigates to the main `menu` route and the application is fully active.

The component transitions through the following states: **Loading** (Lightning SDK bootstraps the renderer, `App._setup()` runs) → **Splash** (onboarding screens: language, network, activation code) → **AppControllerInit** (`AppController.init()` resolves the main client ID, registers key intercepts) → **Active** (main `menu` route, all overlays available, ThunderJS event listeners registered) → **Suspended/Background** (Firebolt `background` lifecycle event received, UI hidden) → **Shutdown** (WPE browser exits).

        App->>Router: navigate / focusWidget
    end

    Runtime->>App: Firebolt background event
    App->>WM: setVisible(mainClientId, false)
```

#### Runtime State Changes

**State Change Triggers:**

- **Power state change** (`onPowerModeChanged` from `org.rdk.PowerManager`): When the device enters `LIGHT_SLEEP` or `DEEP_SLEEP`, all non-power key presses are suppressed. The first key press wakes the device by calling `setPowerState("ON")`.
- **App lifecycle change** (`onAppLifecycleStateChanged` from `org.rdk.AppManager`): When a launched app transitions to `APP_STATE_ACTIVE`, `AppController` makes that app's window visible and focused, and hides the main UI window. When the app exits `APP_STATE_ACTIVE`, the main UI window is brought back into focus.
- **HDMI source change** (`onInputStatusChanged` from `org.rdk.HdmiInput`): The TV overlay is updated to reflect the active HDMI input and triggers navigation to the HDMI input overlay route.
- **Network state change** (events from `org.rdk.NetworkManager`): The `IsConnectedToInternet` flag in `GLOBALS` is updated, and network status is reflected in the settings overlay and top panel.
- **Miracast connection request** (events from `org.rdk.MiracastService`): The `MiracastNotification` overlay is displayed with accept/reject options. The Miracast state in `GLOBALS.Miracastclientdevicedetails` is updated through the connection lifecycle.

**Context Switching Scenarios:**

- When a third-party application is launched, the router navigates to `applauncher`, the main UI window is hidden, and focus is transferred to the application's window client ID.
- On a Home key press while a third-party app is topmost, `jumpToRoute("menu")` is called, which sets the main UI window visible and focused, and calls `AppManager.closeApp()` or lets the lifecycle event handle the app exit.
- On entry into a sleep power state, the inactivity engine is paused by calling `enableInactivityReporting(false)` and is re-enabled on wakeup.

### IPC Flow Patterns

**Primary Request / Response Flow:**

All Thunder plugin interactions follow a uniform Promise-based JSON-RPC pattern. The UI calls an adapter method, which constructs and dispatches a ThunderJS call. The resolved or rejected Promise result is propagated back to the calling screen or widget.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Screen as Screen / Widget
    participant Adapter as API Adapter (src/api/)
    participant ThunderJS as ThunderJS (WebSocket)
    participant Thunder as Thunder Plugin

    Screen->>Adapter: adapter.someMethod(params)
    Adapter->>ThunderJS: thunder.call(callsign, method, params)
    ThunderJS->>Thunder: JSON-RPC Request (port 9998)
    Thunder-->>ThunderJS: JSON-RPC Response
    ThunderJS-->>Adapter: result or error
    Adapter-->>Screen: resolved value / rejected error
```

**Event Notification Flow:**

Adapter classes subscribe to plugin events during `activate()`. When an event arrives, the adapter dispatches it to a registered callback, which was set by the screen or the `App` root component.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Thunder as Thunder Plugin
    participant ThunderJS as ThunderJS (WebSocket)
    participant Adapter as API Adapter
    participant App as App.js / Screen

    Thunder->>ThunderJS: JSON-RPC Event notification
    ThunderJS->>Adapter: event callback (registered via thunder.on())
    Adapter->>App: this._events.get(eventId)(notification)
    App->>App: Update GLOBALS / Router.navigate / widget update
```

### Key Implementation Logic

- **State / Lifecycle Management**: `GLOBALS` (module-level object in `Config.js`) is the authoritative store for runtime state: `topmostApp`, `powerState`, `selfClientId`, `IsConnectedToInternet`, `Miracastclientdevicedetails`. `AppController` maintains the focused client ID and main client ID for window management. State transitions on power mode or app lifecycle events are handled by callbacks registered in `App.js` and `AppController.js`.

- **Event Processing**: Plugin events are registered in each adapter's `activate()` method via `thunder.on(callsign, eventName, callback)`. Callbacks invoke registered handler functions stored in the adapter's `_events` Map. The `App.js` root registers handlers on adapters directly, or adapters forward events to UI components through the Lightning component event system.

- **Error Handling Strategy**: Each adapter wraps ThunderJS calls in Promise constructors. On `catch`, the error is logged via `console.error` and reported to the telemetry layer via `Firebolt.Metrics.error()` with a component-specific error name string. The Promise is typically resolved with a default value (empty array, `false`) rather than rejected, so the UI degrades gracefully. `AppController` uses the `ThunderError` helper class to produce structured error strings.

- **Logging & Diagnostics**: All classes use `console.info`, `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` assigned to `this.INFO`, `this.LOG`, `this.ERR`, `this.WARN` respectively. Log output is available in the WPE browser console or through the device's logging infrastructure.

### Runtime Configuration

The language preference can be changed at runtime through the Settings screen, which writes the selected language code to the `localStorage` key `"Language"`. On the next load, `CONFIG.language` reads this stored value and applies the corresponding locale.

The device power state can be changed at runtime via the `org.rdk.PowerManager` Thunder plugin:

```bash
curl -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"org.rdk.PowerManager.1.setPowerState","params":{"powerState":"STANDBY","standbyReason":"Manual"}}' http://127.0.0.1:9998/jsonrpc
```

### Configuration Persistence

User-configurable settings (language, inactivity timer intervals, energy saver mode) are persisted across reboots via the Lightning `Storage` API (backed by `localStorage` in the WPE browser). Device-level preferences such as voice guidance and audio description are persisted by `org.rdk.UserSettings` and `org.rdk.PersistentStore` on the middleware side.
