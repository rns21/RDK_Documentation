# Sysint

Sysint (System Integration) is the foundational system initialization and lifecycle management component in RDK middleware. It provides the runtime environment that all other middleware components depend on: consistent file-path abstractions, device identity resolution, network bring-up, security policy enforcement, log lifecycle management, and periodic system health monitoring. The component is implemented entirely as a collection of shell scripts, configuration property files, and systemd service and timer units — it acts as the operational integration layer that initializes the device from early boot through to an active, fully monitored state.

At the device level, Sysint ensures every RDK device boots into a known, reproducible operating state. It backs up logs from the previous boot cycle, enforces firewall rules, establishes secure remote-access sessions, initializes compressed swap space, drives the system clock signal chain, triggers crash artifact staging and upload, and recovers autonomously from network connectivity failures. It also coordinates state-change transitions such as factory reset, warehouse reset, and state-red firmware recovery, ensuring orderly teardown and restart of dependent services.

At the module level, Sysint exposes a reusable shell utility library (`utils.sh`), device property abstractions consumed by all other RDK scripts, and a catalogue of well-defined systemd service and timer units against which other components declare ordering dependencies. Its RFC integration layer reads feature-control parameters from the device configuration store at runtime, allowing behavior to be toggled without an image rebuild.

**Key Features & Responsibilities:**

- **Log Lifecycle Management**: Backs up logs from the previous boot cycle into a rolling set of `PreviousLogs` directories before new log files are opened, and runs periodic log rotation via `logrotate` to cap log directory size.
- **Network Management Integration**: Provides NetworkManager dispatcher scripts (`NM_Dispatcher.sh`, `NM_preDown.sh`) that refresh the device IP cache on interface state changes, and runs a periodic network connectivity recovery service that detects and remediates packet-loss and driver-level failures.
- **Security Enforcement**: Applies firewall rules through `iptables_init` at each boot after the network is available, manages the Dropbear SSH server lifecycle with RFC-controlled access lists, and evaluates OCSP/CRL status flags based on RFC parameters.
- **Crash and Dump Management**: Stages core dumps and mini-dumps from the previous session into upload-ready paths, and triggers upload services for both secure and non-secure dump types on network availability.
- **Time Synchronization Event Chain**: Monitors filesystem flags set by the time-sync daemon and emits system event bus signals and D-Bus signals (`org.NtpSync.TimeSet`, `org.Systime.TimeSet`) that downstream components use to gate time-dependent operations.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Periodically collects CPU utilization, free memory, process table snapshots, and disk space metrics, emitting telemetry markers via the Telemetry 2.0 shared API.
- **Disk Space Enforcement**: Monitors configured directory size thresholds using `diskMon.conf` and performs cleanup of stale log and cache files when persistent storage exceeds defined limits.
- **Device Identity Resolution**: Resolves and caches the device identifier and partner identifier from provisioned data files, falling back to bootstrap configuration or compile-time defaults when provisioning files are absent.
- **System Lifecycle Coordination**: Provides the `rebootNow.sh` entry point used by all other RDK components to request an orderly reboot; classifies the originating caller into application-triggered, operations-triggered, or maintenance-triggered categories and persists reboot metadata before invoking the OS reboot.
- **Compressed Swap Initialization**: Conditionally loads the `zram` kernel module and configures compressed swap partitions sized to a configurable percentage of total RAM, controlled by an RFC parameter.
- **Maintenance Task Orchestration**: Coordinates sequenced execution of RFC updates, software update checks, and log upload operations, reporting status events to the system event bus at each stage.

## Design

Sysint is designed as a systemd-centric, script-driven integration layer. Rather than a single long-running daemon, it decomposes each functional responsibility into a dedicated, focused systemd unit — a service, timer, or path unit — that activates only when its specific trigger condition is met. This keeps each unit independently auditable, restartable, and orderable against other units without creating a central point of failure. The design intentionally avoids compiled code; all behavior is expressed in POSIX shell scripts that are easy to read, patch at the field level, and override by replacing individual files.

All scripts share a common property-loading contract: each script sources `/etc/include.properties` for path constants, `/etc/device.properties` for device capability flags, and `/etc/env_setup.sh` for shell aliases. This ensures that paths such as `LOG_PATH`, `UTILITY_PATH`, `PERSISTENT_PATH`, and interface names like `ESTB_INTERFACE` and `WIFI_INTERFACE` are never hardcoded in individual scripts, making the component portable across hardware variants without code changes.

Interaction with the northbound RDK middleware (other systemd services, Thunder plugins) is achieved through two mechanisms: filesystem path units that watch for sentinel files written by those services, and system event bus signals dispatched by `IARM_event_sender` for coarser platform-wide event delivery. Interaction with the southbound OS layer uses standard POSIX interfaces — `systemctl`, `iptables`, `modprobe`, `dbus-send`, and procfs/sysfs.

Data created by Sysint that must survive across reboots is written to the persistent storage path (`/opt`). Reboot metadata is written under `/opt/secure/reboot/` so that the next boot can diagnose unexpected restart causes. Previous-boot log snapshots are retained in `/opt/logs/PreviousLogs/`. Transient state (PID lock files, connectivity flags, NTP event markers) is written to `/tmp` and is automatically discarded at each reboot.

RFC-controlled feature toggles are read at script invocation time via the `tr181Set` utility, enabling features such as ZRAM (`Device.DeviceInfo.X_RDKCENTRAL-COM_RFC.Feature.MEMSWAP.Enable`), USB storage auto-mount, OCSP/CRL policy, and SSH whitelist enforcement to be changed remotely without image reflash.

#### Threading Model

- **Threading Architecture**: All execution is through POSIX shell scripts; each service unit invocation runs as a single-threaded OS process.
- **Main Thread**: Each systemd-activated script runs as a dedicated short-lived process. One-shot services exit after completing their action; timer-triggered services are re-launched by the timer on each interval.
- **Background Execution**: Select scripts fork themselves into the background using the shell `&` operator (`init-zram.sh`, `getDeviceDetails.sh`) so that the parent systemd unit can return without blocking the boot target.
- **Synchronization**: Concurrent-instance protection is implemented with PID lock files (e.g., `/tmp/DiskCheck.pid`, `/tmp/.rebootNow.pid`). A script checks for an existing PID file and exits if a live instance is already running.
- **Async / Event Dispatch**: Systemd path units (`ntp-event.path`, `network-up.path`, `ntp-time-sync.path`, `restart-parodus.path`) watch filesystem paths and activate the corresponding service asynchronously when the watched file appears or changes, decoupling the writing component from the consuming service.

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

#### Platform and Integration Requirements

- **Build Dependencies**: `crashupload` component (Yocto `DEPENDS`); `syslog-ng-config-gen` and `logrotate_config` Yocto class inheritance for log routing and rotation rule generation.
- **Runtime Dependencies**: `bash`, `busybox` (declared as `RDEPENDS`); `logrotate`, `dropbear`, `NetworkManager`, `systemd-timesyncd`, `tr69hostif`, and `parodus` services must be present on the target image.
- **Systemd Services**: The following services must be present before Sysint services reach full operational state: `nvram.service`, `securemount.service`, `tr69hostif.service`, `NetworkManager.service`, `dbus.service`, `network-online.target`.
- **Configuration Files**: `/etc/device.properties`, `/etc/common.properties`, `/etc/include.properties`, `/etc/env_setup.sh`, `/etc/diskMon.conf`, and `/etc/rfcdefaults/sysint-generic.ini` must be installed at the paths defined in `do_install()`.
- **Startup Order**: `previous-log-backup.service` runs before `log-rdk-start.service`; both run before `multi-user.target`. Crash and dump upload services declare `After=network-online.target`.

---

### Component State Flow

#### Initialization to Active State

On each boot, Sysint transitions through a fixed sequence governed by systemd ordering constraints. The earliest units (`previous-log-backup.service`, `log-rdk-start.service`) run before `multi-user.target` and are anchored to `local-fs.target`. Once the local filesystem and NVRAM are available, these units execute. A second wave of services activates at `multi-user.target`: `dump-backup.service`, `iptables.service`, `oops-dump.service`, `zram.service`, and `NM_Bootstrap.service`. A third wave, gated on `network-online.target`, activates the time-sync event chain, crash upload services, SSH daemon, and device detail refresh. After the network reaches a fully verified state, `notify-network-ready.service` writes `/tmp/connectivity_check_done`, which triggers `network-up.path` and activates `network-up.target`, unblocking any services that depend on confirmed internet connectivity.

The component transitions through the following states during its lifecycle: **LogRecovery** (backup previous logs, mark RDK_STARTED) → **SecuritySetup** (iptables rules, OCSP flags, ZRAM) → **NetworkBringup** (NM bootstrap, dispatcher registration) → **TimeSyncMonitoring** (NTP path watches active) → **Active** (all timers running, crash upload paths watching, connection stats running) → **Shutdown** (individual services are stopped via `systemctl stop`).

```

#### Runtime State Changes

Once all boot-time services have completed, Sysint operates through timer-driven and path-driven activations, re-entering active execution each time a timer fires or a watched filesystem path changes.

**State Change Triggers:**

- `vitalprocess-info.timer` fires 150 seconds after boot and every 600 seconds thereafter, invoking `system_info_collector.sh` to collect CPU, memory, disk, and process metrics and emit Telemetry 2.0 markers.
- `logrotate.timer` runs on its configured schedule, invoking `logrotate` against `/etc/logrotatedata.conf` to cap log file sizes.
- `disk-threshold-check.timer` periodically invokes `disk_threshold_check.sh` to detect and remediate persistent storage exceeding configured thresholds.
- `network-connection-stats.timer` periodically invokes `networkConnectionRecovery.sh` to check gateway reachability, packet loss, and WiFi driver health; it triggers reassociation or a driver reset when configurable thresholds are exceeded.
- `ntp-event.path` watches `/tmp/clock-event` (or `/run/systemd/timesync/synchronized` on Dunfell builds). When the time-sync daemon writes this file, `ntp-event.service` fires, dispatching a system event bus signal `NTPReceivedEvent` and logging the `CONNECT_TO_NTP_SERVER` milestone.
- `restart-parodus.path` watches `/tmp/authservice_parodus_restart`. When this file appears, `restart-parodus.service` invokes `systemctl restart parodus.service` after `wpeframework.service` is confirmed active.
- `stateRedRecovery.path` watches a sentinel file; when triggered, `stateRedRecovery.sh` initiates a recovery firmware download via `rdkvfwupgrader`.

**Context Switching Scenarios:**

- **Factory Reset**: `factory-reset.sh` stops dependent services (sysmgr, storagemgr, socprovisioning, lighttpd, dnsmasq, Dobby, WiFi), clears controller-pairing data and persistent state, and triggers a reboot via `rebootNow.sh`.
- **Warehouse Reset**: `warehouse-reset.sh` follows a similar service teardown sequence with warehouse-specific data erasure.
- **State Red**: `stateRedRecovery.sh` calls `rdkvfwupgrader` with recovery parameters to initiate an emergency firmware download without requiring a full UI-driven update.
- **Cyclic Reboot Detection**: `rebootNow.sh` reads a reboot counter from `/opt/secure/reboot/rebootCounter` and applies a pause window if the counter exceeds the threshold (`REBOOT_CYCLE_THRESHOLD=5` within `REBOOT_WINDOW=10` minutes), preventing uncontrolled boot loops.

#### Reboot Management Call Flow

The reboot management flow is the most widely invoked Sysint interface: all other RDK components call `rebootNow.sh` to request an orderly device restart. The script validates the caller-provided arguments, classifies the reboot reason, enforces a cyclic-reboot guard, persists reboot metadata, and delegates to the OS reboot command.

The `ntp-event.service` dispatches the `NTPReceivedEvent` system event bus signal and marks the `CONNECT_TO_NTP_SERVER` log milestone. Path units watch filesystem flags to trigger these services asynchronously.                                                                                          | `lib/rdk/send-time-events.sh`, `systemd_units/ntp-event.service`, `systemd_units/ntp-event.path`, `systemd_units/ntp-time-sync.path`, `systemd_units/system-time-event.service`                           |
| `Crash Management`            | `dumpbackup.sh` stages core dumps and mini-dumps from the kernel crash path into upload-ready directories at boot. Path units watch those directories; on a new file, the corresponding upload service transfers the dump to the configured crash server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `lib/rdk/dumpbackup.sh`, `systemd_units/coredump-upload.service`, `systemd_units/coredump-secure-upload.service`, `systemd_units/minidump-upload.service`, `systemd_units/minidump-secure-upload.service` |
| `Disk Management`             | `disk_threshold_check.sh` monitors `/opt` utilization and removes stale log and cache files when the fill level exceeds a configurable threshold (80% for flash, 90% for HDD). `diskMon.sh` independently verifies that specific directories do not exceed the size limits declared in `diskMon.conf`.                                                                                                                                                                   | `lib/rdk/disk_threshold_check.sh`, `lib/rdk/diskMon.sh`, `etc/diskMon.conf`                                                                                                                               |
| `Device Identity`             | `getDeviceId.sh` resolves device ID and partner ID from provisioned data files, falling back to bootstrap configuration or a compile-time default. `getDeviceDetails.sh` caches device IP address, MAC address, and model information in `/tmp/.deviceDetails.cache` for consumption by other scripts and services.                                                                                                                                                      | `lib/rdk/getDeviceId.sh`, `lib/rdk/getDeviceDetails.sh`                                                                                                                                                   |
| `System Lifecycle`            | `rebootNow.sh` provides the unified reboot interface for all RDK components, classifying the caller and persisting reboot metadata before issuing the OS reboot. `factory-reset.sh` and `warehouse-reset.sh` orchestrate service teardown and data erasure. `stateRedRecovery.sh` triggers emergency firmware download via `rdkvfwupgrader`.                                                                                                                             | `lib/rdk/rebootNow.sh`, `lib/rdk/factory-reset.sh`, `lib/rdk/warehouse-reset.sh`, `lib/rdk/stateRedRecovery.sh`                                                                                           |
| `Memory Management`           | `init-zram.sh` reads the `MEMSWAP.Enable` RFC parameter, loads the `zram` kernel module with a device count matching the CPU count, and configures compressed swap partitions sized to a configurable percentage (default 50%) of total RAM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `lib/rdk/init-zram.sh`, `systemd_units/zram.service`                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Maintenance Orchestration`   | `Start_MaintenanceTasks.sh` sequences RFC fetch, software update check, and log upload operations, dispatching system event bus progress and completion events at each stage for consumption by the Maintenance Manager plugin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `lib/rdk/Start_MaintenanceTasks.sh`                                                                                                                                                                       |

### IPC Flow Patterns

**NTP Event Notification Flow:**

The NTP event chain is driven entirely by filesystem path monitoring. No polling occurs: systemd watches the sentinel file, and the event dispatch service activates only when the condition is met.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant TimeSyncd as systemd-timesyncd
    participant NTPPath as ntp-event.path (systemd)
    participant NTPSvc as ntp-event.service
    participant EvtBus as System Event Bus
    participant NTPTimeSyncPath as ntp-time-sync.path (systemd)
    participant NTPTimeSyncSvc as ntp-time-sync-event.service
    participant DBus as D-Bus

    TimeSyncd->>TimeSyncd: NTP synchronization complete
    TimeSyncd->>NTPPath: Write /tmp/clock-event
    NTPPath->>NTPSvc: PathChanged — activate
    NTPSvc->>NTPSvc: touch /tmp/stt_received
    NTPSvc->>NTPSvc: rdkLogMileStone CONNECT_TO_NTP_SERVER
    NTPSvc->>EvtBus: IARM_event_sender NTPReceivedEvent 1

    Note over NTPTimeSyncPath: Watches /tmp/systimemgr/ntp
    NTPTimeSyncPath->>NTPTimeSyncSvc: PathChanged — activate
    NTPTimeSyncSvc->>DBus: dbus-send org.NtpSync.TimeSet
```

**Network Ready Detection Flow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant NMSvc as NetworkManager
    participant NMDisp as NM_Dispatcher.sh
    participant NotifyNet as notify-network-ready.service
    participant NetUpPath as network-up.path (systemd)
    participant NetUpTgt as network-up.target

    NMSvc->>NMDisp: Interface up event (dispatcher callback)
    NMDisp->>NMDisp: refresh_devicedetails — update IP cache
    NMDisp->>NotifyNet: (network connectivity confirmed externally)
    NotifyNet->>NotifyNet: touch /tmp/connectivity_check_done
    NotifyNet->>NotifyNet: logMilestone.sh INTERNET_FULLY_CONNECTED
    NetUpPath->>NetUpTgt: PathChanged /tmp/connectivity_check_done — activate network-up.target
    NetUpTgt-->>NotifyNet: Dependent services unblocked
```

## Implementation Details

### Hardware Interface Usage

Sysint interacts with hardware through standard Linux kernel interfaces. CPU and memory metrics are read from procfs paths including `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/proc/uptime`. Thermal readings and ION heap information are retrieved from sysfs at `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` and `/sys/kernel/debug/ion/heaps/`. Storage utilization is measured using `df` and filesystem utilities. Kernel modules including `zram` are managed via `modprobe`. Network packet filtering rules are applied through `iptables` and `ip6tables` calls within `iptables_init`.

### Key Implementation Logic

- **State / Lifecycle Management**: Reboot state is tracked via a persistent counter and metadata files under `/opt/secure/reboot/` (`reboot.info`, `rebootCounter`, `rebootNow`). The cyclic reboot guard in `rebootNow.sh` reads this counter at each invocation and applies a time-window pause if the threshold is exceeded. Factory and warehouse reset states are signaled to dependent services by stopping them via `systemctl stop` before clearing data.
  - Reboot management: `lib/rdk/rebootNow.sh`
  - Reset orchestration: `lib/rdk/factory-reset.sh`, `lib/rdk/warehouse-reset.sh`

- **Event Processing**: All event dispatch in Sysint is one-shot and synchronous within the activating script. Systemd path units provide the asynchronous edge-trigger mechanism: the component that writes the sentinel file is decoupled from the consuming service — each side operates independently. System event bus notifications are dispatched as fire-and-forget calls via the `IARM_event_sender` utility.

- **Error Handling Strategy**: Scripts use early-exit patterns when mandatory arguments or files are missing (e.g., `rebootNow.sh` exits with a usage message if fewer than two arguments are provided). Disk threshold checks write a PID lock file and exit immediately if a concurrent instance is detected. The network recovery script tracks consecutive failure counts per condition type before taking corrective action, avoiding false-positive resets.

- **Logging & Diagnostics**: All scripts use a consistent log pattern: ``echo "`/bin/timestamp`: $0: $*" >> $LOG_FILE``. The `rebootNow.sh` script maintains a dedicated `/opt/logs/rebootreason.log`. The network recovery script writes to `/opt/logs/ConnectionStats.txt`. Systemd unit logs are captured by syslog-ng into service-specific destinations configured at build time via the `SYSLOG-NG_*` variables in the Yocto recipe.

### Build-Time Configurations

The following flags are evaluated in the Yocto recipe's `do_install()` and control which files and properties are deployed into the image. They are derived from `DISTRO_FEATURES` and `bb.utils.contains` conditional evaluations in `sysint_git.bb`.

### Runtime Configuration

RFC parameters can be updated remotely via the RFC server. After a parameter push, the feature takes effect at the next activation of the relevant Sysint script — timer-driven services apply the change on the next timer interval, while one-shot boot services apply it on the next reboot. SSH whitelist and SNMP whitelist files can be refreshed at runtime by placing updated list files in the RFC RAM path (`/tmp/RFC/.RFC_SSHWhiteList.list`) and invoking `iptables_init` with the refresh flag.

### Configuration Persistence

Device properties (`/etc/device.properties`, `/etc/include.properties`, `/etc/common.properties`) are baked into the image and remain constant across reboots. RFC parameter overrides are stored in `/opt/persistent/rfc.properties` (non-production builds) or read from `/etc/rfc.properties` (production builds) and persist across reboots. Reboot metadata under `/opt/secure/reboot/` and the device details cache at `/tmp/.deviceDetails.cache` are managed by Sysint scripts directly; the cache file resides in `/tmp` and is refreshed each boot cycle, while reboot metadata in `/opt/secure` persists across reboots. Log files under `/opt/logs/` are retained across reboots and managed by `logrotate`.
