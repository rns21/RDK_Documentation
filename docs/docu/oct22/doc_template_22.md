# [COMPONENT_NAME] Documentation

[Describe in detail of the functionality served by this component in RDK middleware. This information can be split into 3 different sections. The first section can provide an overview on this component, the second section can tell on the services it provides to the end product/stack as a device, and the last section can explain the services provided by this module in a module level]

[Add a C4 System Context Diagram to explain the position of this component in the whole RDK-B architecture. Explain the components in high level especially the software systems . Possible components are External systems(which might be a remote management component or web ui or a firmware upgrade server etc. ), this component, other RDK-B components in RDK-B middleware, HAL/physical layer/OS layer ].

**Key Features & Responsibilities**: 

[List major functions, services provided, and responsibilities. Keep it as a bullet point list. Keep the main point as BOLD text formatting and then explain in a sentence or maximum two on what that point is about]

## Design

[Explain the design principles of the component in a detailed way. This can be in two sections. The first section can have an overview of design principles in a paragraph of 5-6 sentences. After that, deep dive into  how the design of the system meets the requirements/features in an optimal way.] 
[Explain how the interactions with other layers - the north bound and south bound - are taken care in the design]
[Explain how the IPC mechanisms are integrated in the design - possible rbus or dbus.]
[Explain the data persistance, storage management etc, achieved for this component - either within itself or via other designated RDK-B or system components]

[Add a C4 Component Diagram with a text like - A Component diagram showing the component's internal structure and dependencies is given below:. The starting point of this diagram will be the context diagram created above, with the part of this specific component being expanded. The main components will have to cover the message bus registration(rbus or dbus or both), telemetry, persistant data set/get, get/set data from/to HAL, as well as various other components as the case may be]
