# Core Net Library Documentation

The Core Net Library (CNL) is a fundamental networking utility library in the RDK-B middleware that provides a comprehensive C API for network interface management, bridge operations, VLAN configuration, and routing table manipulation. This component serves as a critical abstraction layer between RDK-B middleware components and the underlying Linux networking subsystem, utilizing netlink sockets for kernel communication and providing a simplified, safe API for complex networking operations.

This library enables RDK-B components to perform network configuration tasks without directly interfacing with low-level kernel APIs. It provides services essential for device networking functionality including interface state management, bridge creation and configuration, VLAN management, route table manipulation, and neighbor table operations. The component is designed to be thread-safe and provides error handling mechanisms that allow calling components to gracefully handle networking failures.

At the module level, the Core Net Library provides standardized APIs for network interface lifecycle management (create, configure, delete), bridge networking capabilities for creating software bridges and managing bridge ports, VLAN tagging and untagging functionality, routing table management for both IPv4 and IPv6, and neighbor table operations for ARP/NDP management.

## Design

The Core Net Library follows a layered architecture design that abstracts the complexity of Linux networking APIs while providing a safe, reliable interface for network operations. The design is built around the principle of providing a single, unified API that encapsulates various networking subsystems including interface management, bridging, VLANs, and routing. The component uses the netlink socket interface extensively to communicate with the Linux kernel's networking subsystem, ensuring efficient and direct kernel communication without requiring external utilities.

The design emphasizes thread safety through careful resource management and proper socket handling. Each major operation follows a consistent pattern of socket allocation, connection establishment, operation execution, and resource cleanup. Error handling is comprehensive, with detailed logging and status codes that allow calling components to make informed decisions about failure recovery. The component abstracts away the complexity of netlink message construction and parsing, providing simple function calls that hide the underlying kernel communication protocols.

The northbound interface provides clean C APIs that can be easily consumed by other RDK-B middleware components, while the southbound interface efficiently utilizes netlink sockets for kernel communication. The IPC mechanism is primarily based on function calls within the same process space, as this is a library component rather than a standalone service. Data persistence is handled by the calling components, though the library provides utilities for reading and writing configuration files when needed.

### Prerequisites and Dependencies

**Build-Time Flags and Configuration:**

| Configure Option | DISTRO Feature | Build Flag | Purpose | Default |
|------------------|----------------|------------|---------|---------|
| `--enable-gtestapp` | N/A | `GTEST_ENABLE`, `WITH_GTEST_SUPPORT` | Enable Google Test support for unit testing framework | Disabled |

<br>

**RDK-B Platform and Integration Requirements**

- **RDK-B Components**: No mandatory RDK-B middleware component dependencies as this is a foundational library consumed by other components
- **HAL Dependencies**: Standard Linux networking interfaces - no specific HAL requirements as the library operates directly with kernel APIs
- **Systemd Services**: No specific systemd service dependencies - library is loaded as needed by consuming components
- **Message Bus**: No RBus registration requirements - operates as a static/shared library within calling process
- **Configuration Files**: No mandatory configuration files - operates using runtime parameters passed through API calls
- **Startup Order**: Must be available during system initialization as networking components depend on this library for basic operations

**Threading Model** 

The Core Net Library implements a thread-safe library design where each API call is atomic and self-contained. The component does not create or manage its own threads, but rather provides thread-safe functions that can be called from any thread context within consuming applications.

- **Threading Architecture**: Single-threaded library with thread-safe API design - no internal threading model
- **Main Thread**: All operations execute in the context of the calling thread with proper resource isolation and cleanup
- **Synchronization**: Thread safety is achieved through stateless design and proper resource management - each function call manages its own netlink socket and resources independently

### Component State Flow

**Initialization to Active State**

The Core Net Library has no explicit initialization or active state management since it operates as a stateless library. Each API function handles its own initialization, operation, and cleanup cycle. The library becomes "active" when first called and remains available throughout the process lifetime.

    App->>CNL: First API Call (e.g., interface_create)
    Note over CNL: State: Initializing<br/>Allocate socket, setup netlink connection

    Note over CNL: State: Connected → Processing
    
    CNL->>Kernel: Netlink Message (Operation Request)

    Note over CNL: State: Processing → Cleanup

    Note over CNL: State: Ready for Next Call
    
    loop Subsequent API Calls
        App->>CNL: API Call

        CNL->>CNL: Execute → Cleanup → Return
        CNL-->>App: Result
    end
```

**Runtime State Changes and Context Switching**

The Core Net Library maintains no persistent runtime state. Each function call creates its own execution context, performs the requested operation, and cleans up all resources before returning. This stateless design ensures that there are no context switches or state management complexities.

**State Change Triggers:**

- Function entry triggers resource allocation and socket creation
- Netlink operation completion triggers resource cleanup
- Function exit ensures complete resource deallocation

**Context Switching Scenarios:**

- No context switching occurs as each API call is independent and atomic
- Error conditions trigger immediate cleanup and return without affecting subsequent calls

## Component Interactions

The Core Net Library serves as a foundational networking component that is consumed by multiple RDK-B middleware components. It does not initiate interactions but responds to API calls from consuming components. The library interfaces directly with the Linux kernel through netlink sockets and provides abstraction for complex networking operations.

### Interaction Matrix

```

## Implementation Details

### Major HAL APIs Integration

The Core Net Library operates at a lower level than typical HAL abstractions, directly interfacing with the Linux kernel through netlink sockets. It does not consume traditional HAL APIs but instead provides the foundational networking capabilities that higher-level HAL implementations might use.

**Core Linux APIs:**

| Linux API | Purpose | Implementation File |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Netlink Socket API** | Primary interface for kernel networking communication using NETLINK_ROUTE protocol | `libnet.c`, `libnet_util.c` |
| **File System API** | Reading/writing kernel parameters and network configuration through /proc and /sys | `libnet.c` (file_read, file_write) |
| **libnl3 Library** | Higher-level netlink abstraction for route, address, and interface management | All networking functions in `libnet.c` |

### Key Implementation Logic

- **Netlink Socket Management**: Core implementation centers around proper netlink socket lifecycle management with consistent patterns across all networking operations
     - Socket allocation and connection in `libnet_util.c` (libnet_alloc_socket, libnet_connect)
     - Resource cleanup and error handling in each API function
  
- **Resource Management**: Comprehensive resource management ensures no memory leaks or socket handle exhaustion
     - Automatic cleanup on both success and error paths
     - Cache management for interface and route information
     - Proper reference counting for netlink objects

- **Error Handling Strategy**: Robust error detection and reporting with detailed logging for debugging network configuration issues
     - Netlink error code translation to CNL status codes
     - Comprehensive logging with CNL_LOG_* macros for different severity levels
     - Graceful degradation and resource cleanup on failures

- **Thread Safety Implementation**: Thread-safe design through stateless operation and proper resource isolation
     - Each API call manages independent socket and cache resources
     - No shared state between function calls
     - Atomic operations with complete setup and cleanup cycles

### Key Configuration Files

The Core Net Library does not require or manage specific configuration files. It operates using runtime parameters and provides utilities for reading and writing system configuration files as needed by consuming components.

| Configuration File | Purpose | Override Mechanisms |
|--------------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Runtime Parameters** | All configuration passed via function parameters | Environment variables in calling applications |
| **/proc/sys/net/*** | Kernel networking parameters accessible via file_read/file_write | Direct file operations with proper validation |
| **/sys/class/net/*** | Network interface attributes and statistics | Interface-specific file operations through library APIs |
