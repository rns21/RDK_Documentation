## Video User Interface Preview

The front end of any video device is the user interface that consumers will see. RDK comes with an open-source UI written in Lightningâ„¢ , or you can create your own. To experience the RDK UI, watch the Video:

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="../images/rdk-ui.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


**Try Out RDK**

If you want to play around RDK, a port of RDK is available on the popular open source platform Raspberry Pi. A guide on how to bring up RDK for Entertainment in Raspberry Pi is available [here](../../entertainment/docs/tryout_rdkv.md)
