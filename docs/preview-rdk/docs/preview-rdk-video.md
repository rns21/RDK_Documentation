**RDK for Entertainment**
RDK middleware enables operators to add video streaming capabilities to their IP or hybrid devices. The latest version of the RDK Video software stack is designed to simplify app development and integration on any set-top device, while allowing companies to maintain complete control of their apps, device data, and customer experience. This is achieved through Firebolt™, the RDK application platform, which ensures compatibility with the latest app releases, eliminating the need for future updates. The seamless integration of global streaming apps provides operators with an easy path to offer subscribers today's most popular content.
