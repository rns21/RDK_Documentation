# Application Support in RDK

Applications are a core part of the RDK experience, acting as a bridge between service providers and end users. The RDK app ecosystem enables operators and developers to deliver rich, secure, and high-performance applications, leveraging platform services, device capabilities, and standardized APIs for video devices.

* **OTT & Entertainment**: Streaming services, live TV, interactive content.
* **Gaming & Interactive**: Lightweight games and interactive user interfaces.
* **Operator Services**: Exclusive apps and third-party service integrations.

## RDK Application Frameworks

To enable application development, lifecycle management, and integration, RDK provides two major frameworks:

### Firebolt™

Firebolt™ enables developers to create Lightning™, HTML5, or native applications without needing direct access to the RDK source code. It offers a standardized set of interfaces for accessing system resources and services, along with a comprehensive runtime environment for testing and executing applications during development. Designed to simplify onboarding, the framework empowers developers with the flexibility to implement solutions independently of the underlying platform

### Lightning™

Lightning™ - the JavaScript based app development language - provides a lightweight, highly-efficient UI framework for app developers.
