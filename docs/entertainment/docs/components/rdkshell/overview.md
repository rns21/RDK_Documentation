# RDKShell Overview

## Introduction

RDKShell is a native component that serves as the foundational application management, composition, and input handling system within the RDK (Reference Design Kit) ecosystem. It functions as a sophisticated window manager and compositor that provides comprehensive control over application lifecycle, display composition, and advanced input event processing for set-top boxes, smart TVs, and other RDK-enabled devices.

## Core Functionalities

RDKShell operates as the central orchestrator between the underlying graphics subsystem and applications running on RDK devices. It bridges the gap between low-level graphics capabilities and high-level application requirements by providing a unified interface for application management and display composition. The component integrates deeply with the Wayland display server protocol through Westeros and leverages Essos for flexible windowing system connectivity, enabling it to work seamlessly across different hardware platforms and display configurations.

    **Wayland + Westeros + Essos**: RDKShell uses these to ensure cross-platform compatibility and modern graphics integration.

The module serves as the primary interface for system-level operations such as launching applications, managing their visual presentation, controlling their z-order positioning, and handling complex input event routing. This makes RDKShell essential for creating cohesive user experiences where multiple applications can coexist and interact appropriately within the same display environment.

## Core Capabilities

### Application Lifecycle Management

RDKShell provides comprehensive application lifecycle management capabilities that extend beyond simple process control. It manages the complete lifecycle from application launch through suspension, resumption, and termination. The system maintains detailed state information for each managed application, including their display properties, input event subscriptions, and resource allocations. This enables sophisticated power management scenarios where applications can be suspended to conserve resources while maintaining their visual state for quick resumption.

!!! note
    Applications can register for lifecycle events to preserve state and perform cleanup during transitions.

The lifecycle management system supports both traditional application models where applications run continuously and modern power-efficient models where applications can be dynamically suspended and resumed based on user interaction patterns and system resource availability. Applications can register for lifecycle events to perform appropriate cleanup and state preservation operations during transitions.

### Advanced Display Composition

The composition engine within RDKShell handles complex multi-application display scenarios with pixel-perfect precision. It supports arbitrary positioning, scaling, rotation, and opacity control for each application window. The system can handle both traditional rectangular windows and more complex shapes through its integration with OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering pipelines. Advanced features include support for virtual displays, where applications can render to off-screen buffers for scenarios like picture-in-picture or thumbnail generation.

!!! tip
    Supports both hardware-accelerated and software rendering, with fallback to software when hardware isn't available.

The compositor supports hardware-accelerated composition when available, automatically falling back to software rendering when necessary. It includes sophisticated damage tracking to minimize unnecessary redraws and optimize performance on resource-constrained devices. The system can handle multiple display outputs simultaneously, enabling scenarios where different applications are displayed on different screens or display zones.

### Sophisticated Input Event Management

RDKShell implements a highly configurable input event management system that goes far beyond simple key forwarding. Applications can register for specific key combinations even when they are not in focus, enabling global hotkey functionality and complex input routing scenarios. The system supports both physical key events from various input devices and virtual key generation for programmatic input simulation. Input event metadata is preserved and can be used for advanced input processing scenarios.

The input management system includes support for multiple input device types including traditional keyboards, remote controls, game controllers, and touch interfaces. It provides sophisticated key mapping capabilities that can translate between different input device protocols and key code formats. The system supports configurable key repeat rates, modifier key combinations, and complex input event filtering based on application requirements and system policies.

### Memory and Resource Monitoring

The component includes comprehensive system resource monitoring capabilities with configurable thresholds and automatic notification systems. It continuously monitors RAM usage, swap utilization, and can trigger low-memory notifications to applications and system components. This enables proactive resource management and helps prevent system instability due to resource exhaustion.

!!! warning
    Applications should respond to low-memory warnings by reducing cache or suspending non-critical features.

The monitoring system operates in a separate thread to avoid impacting the main rendering loop performance. It provides both immediate notifications for critical resource conditions and periodic reports for trend analysis. Applications can register for different types of resource notifications and adjust their behavior accordingly, such as reducing cache sizes or suspending non-essential operations during low-memory conditions.

### Multi-Protocol Communication

RDKShell supports multiple communication protocols to accommodate different integration scenarios. It provides JSON-RPC APIs over both traditional socket-based IPC and modern WebSocket connections. Additionally, it offers direct C++ APIs for native code integration. This flexibility allows it to integrate with various system architectures and application frameworks commonly used in the RDK ecosystem.
